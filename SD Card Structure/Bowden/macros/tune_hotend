;This file is an example of re-tuning the hot end (H1 on the Bowden).  
;It is suggested to set the following subsystems to near the state they will be in during prints:
;1 - Bed temperature m140 s65 sets the bed to 65C
;2 - Print cooling fan  m106 p1 s0.5 sets this fan to 50% speed
;3 - Toolhead cooling fan (automatic with thermostatic defaults)
;4 - Use a target temperature near the printing temperatures commonly used, i.e. 215C or 255C or in between.

M140 S65
M106 P1 S0.5
M303 H1 P1 S240
