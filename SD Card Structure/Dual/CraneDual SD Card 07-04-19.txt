070419 Necessary improvements to print start and idle current to decrease grind through due to backpressure between ports

062719 Improving prime start so it is quicker, easier to remove, not brittle due to crystalization from low pressure
increase idle current for better backpressure resistance when motor ports aren't used.

060519 Updates: Includes default firmware retraction code in motion.g

060419 Modified max E steps to prevent grind through in long prints with bad reprime settings

052519 A series of small updates to optimize things like Z probing by itself for speedy z=0 positioning of the limit switch using the LCD menu home other > Z > repeat;  Better extrusion steps/mm for the average dual printer

051519 A series of updates to improve the thermal performance of duals.  Added a series of improvements focusing on dual mix settings and better loading procedures.

041219 Updated to include print_start and print_end gcode priming and finish files (required for cura settings)
