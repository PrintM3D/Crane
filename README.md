# Crane Software -- Latest SD Card Release

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to transfer the entire File Structure to your Crane's SD Card, you will need to power off the Crane, remove the SD card, and access it with an SD card reader.  
  
REMEMBER:  Don't remove the Duet Maestro's SD Card from the crane while the machine in powered on.  Likewise, do not insert an SD Card while the system is powered on.
